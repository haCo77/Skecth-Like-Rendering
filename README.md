Implementation Details
---
- The Flower. Generated by raymarching SDFs. It consists of 3 layers. For each layer a repetition of part of a sphere is performed along with a symmetry operation.
- Soft Shadow. Cast ray from the ground to light source to create soft shadows. The shadow parameter is calculated as k * h / t, where h is the nearest distance to an obstacle and t is the distance traveled along the ray at that point. k is a coefficient to control the size of shadow.
- Hatching. Multiply the Lambert shading color and a grid color (draw along principal curvature directions, or a fixed grid)
- Occluding Contours. Find the first point on a ray which has a local minimum SDF value in the direction of the ray and this value should less than a given threshold.
- Suggestive Contours. Find local minimum of n(normal) dot v(view direction) in the projected view direction.

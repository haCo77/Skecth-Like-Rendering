Implementation Details

- The Skecth \
    __The Flower__. Generated by raymarching SDFs. It consists of 3 layers. For each layer a repetition operation is performed on the petals. Each petal is part of a sphere with a symmetry operation. \
    __Soft Shadow__. Cast ray from the ground to the light source to create soft shadows. The shadow parameter is calculated as k * h / t, where h is the nearest distance to an obstacle and t is the distance traveled along the ray at the nearest point. k is a coefficient to control the size of shadow. \
    __Hatching__. Multiply the Lambert shading color and a grid color. Grid color is generated from sine functions. \
    __Occluding Contours__. Find the first point on a ray with has a local minimum SDF value and this value should be less than a given threshold. \
    __Suggestive Contours__. Find local minimum of n(normal) dot v(view direction) in the projected view direction. \
- Textures. The skecth is rendered into a framebuffer and serves as a texture for the paper. The wood backgorund of the scene is also a texture.
- The Pencil. Generated by raymarching SDFs. It consists of a hexagonal prism, a cone, a cylinder and a capsule. Sine function noises are added to the radius of the cylinder to create the pattern of the metal part. I use the Schlick's approximation to estimate the specular reflection coefficient and shade the metal accordingly.
- Anti-Alias. Compute four neighburing colors and average the result to anti-alias. For the speed of rendering AA is not used by default.
- Bounding Box. I use bounding box for each SDF geometry to speed up the raymarching process.
- Vignette. Decay the color of each pixel according to the coordinates of the intersection of the rays to achieve a vignette effect.
